</p><p>This tutorial will walk you through the different functionalities of the <a href="BIM_Workbench.html" title="BIM Workbench">BIM Workbench</a> and help you to get on track by modeling a very simple pavilion building. It should take between one and two hours to complete entirely, depending on your previous experience with 3D applications.
</p><p>You can pause the tutorial at any time and resume it later by selecting <b>Help &rarr; BIM Tutorial</b> again.
</p><p>Some steps of this tutorial require you to take actions. Those will be indicated below this text box, with an icon showing if the task has been completed or not. But since we are good people here at FreeCAD, it is not mandatory to complete the actions in order to advance through these pages. You can just browse through the tutorial and skip actions at your convenience.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Set_FreeCAD_up">Set FreeCAD up</span></h3>
<p>FreeCAD has a large preferences system with many options to set, located under menu <b>Edit &rarr; Preferences</b>. Each additional workbench can add more preferences pages, which makes it very complex. 
</p><p>The BIM Workbench provides a <a href="BIM_Setup.html" title="BIM Setup">simplified setup window</a>, which allows to quickly set some of the most useful preferences for BIM work. This setup window is located under menu <b>Manage &rarr; BIM Setup&hellip;</b> (you can also click  the corresponding button on the Manage toolbar):

</p><p>Open the simplified setup window now, and set the different options to your liking. 
</p><p>In case of need, hover the mouse over any option or setting to see a description of what it is used for:

</p><p>In this tutorial, we will work in centimeters. Therefore, we recommend that you set your preferred working units to <b>centimeters</b> and the default size of a grid square to <b>10 cm</b>. These settings can be changed at any time from the working plane button located on the main toolbar, and the units indicator located on the Status Bar (bottom right):

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Create_a_new_document">Create a new document</span></h3>
<p>If you just installed FreeCAD, you are probably currently looking at the <b>FreeCAD Start Page</b>:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_tutorial_13.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190108124038&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_tutorial_13.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="186" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="186"></a></span>
</p><p>The start page lists the latest documents you have been working with, and, on its different tabs, explains how to get help. But in order to start working, we need to create a new, empty <b>document</b>. If you haven't done it yet, create now a new document by using the "Create new&hellip;" item of the start page, or by navigating to menu <b>File &rarr; New</b>:

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Navigating_in_the_3D_View">Navigating in the 3D View</span></h3>
<p>There are several ways to interact with the mouse in FreeCAD. These are called <a href="Mouse_navigation.html" title="Mouse navigation">navigation styles</a>. You can change the current navigation style anytime by clicking on the navigation style button in the Status Bar. Hovering the mouse over that button will also show you what each mouse button does. Several of them are made to match other well-known applications. Choose one you are comfortable with.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_03.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20181113203611&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_03.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="182" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="712" data-file-height="433"></a></span>
</p><p>Controlling how you look at your model in the 3D View can be done in multiple ways: Using the <b>mouse</b> (depending on the navigation style you chose), the <b>keyboard</b> (explore the contents of the <b>View</b> menu to find out more), or the <a href="Navigation_Cube.html" title="Navigation Cube">Navigation Cube</a> (click the different arrows and faces of the cube to align the view).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reorganize_the_interface">Reorganize the interface</span></h3>
<p>All panels and toolbars in FreeCAD can be moved and reorganized. Larger panels can also be joined by dragging and dropping them on another one. If your screen is too small to display all the toolbars and their contents (truncated toolbars will appear with a &gt;&gt; sign), it might be a good idea to move them to a better position.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_05.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20181114134442&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_05.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="178" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="435" data-file-height="258"></a></span>
</p><p>Toolbars and panels can also be turned on and off from the <b>View</b> menu.
</p><p>The BIM Workbench also features switch buttons in the Status Bar, that turns additional panels like selection view, report view and Python Console on and off. These panels are often useful while working with FreeCAD, but they use precious screen space. You can usually turn everything off until you need them. Remember that error messages are printed in the report window, so in case anything goes wrong, be sure to have a look there.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_BIM_Workbench_tools">The BIM Workbench tools</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="BIM_Workbench.html" title="BIM Workbench">BIM Workbench</a> contains tools borrowed from other workbenches such as <a href="Draft_Workbench.html" title="Draft Workbench">Draft</a> or <a href="Part_Workbench.html" title="Part Workbench">Part</a>, as well as its own tools. These are organized in several categories. Each category has a menu and a toolbar.
</p><p>Each tool has its own documentation page that describes in detail how it works and which options are available. The BIM tools are listed on the <a href="BIM_Workbench.html" title="BIM Workbench">BIM Workbench</a> page, which is accessible from the menu: <b>Help &rarr; BIM Help</b>. To directly open the doocumentation for a specific tool use <b>Help &rarr; What's this?</b> and click on its toolbar button.
</p><p>Take a moment to explore the contents of the menus described below.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="2D_Drafting">2D Drafting</span></h4>
<p>These tools allow you to draw flat objects, such as lines, polylines, rectangles, arcs, etc&hellip; that will become the bases of your BIM objects. For example, you can use a polyline to define the base trace of a wall, or a rectangle as a profile for a beam. All 2D objects are created in the current <a href="Draft_SelectPlane.html" title="Draft SelectPlane">working plane</a>.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_35.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200409110235&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_35.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="205" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="205"></a></span>
</p>
<h4><span id="3D.2FBIM"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="3D/BIM">3D/BIM</span></h4>
<p>This category contains tools to create BIM objects such as <a href="Arch_Wall.html" title="Arch Wall">walls</a> or <a href="Arch_Window.html" title="Arch Window">windows</a>, and generic, non-BIM 3D objects such as <a href="BIM_Box.html" title="BIM Box">boxes</a>, that you can turn into BIM objects later on. The result is different if you use the tool with an object selected or not. If not, you will be presented with a creation interface. If you have selected an object before running the tool, an object of the corresponding type will be created using the selected object as a base. 
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_33.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200409110109&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_33.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="228" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="228"></a></span>
</p><p>A typical example is to press the <a href="Arch_Wall.html" title="Arch Wall">wall</a> button with a selected <a href="Draft_Line.html" title="Draft Line">line</a> or <a href="Draft_Wire.html" title="Draft Wire">polyline</a>. A wall will be created automatically, using the line or polyline as its baseline.
</p><p>Non-BIM objects, including objects made in other workbenches, can be turned into BIM objects anytime, by selecting them and pressing any of the BIM tool buttons.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Annotation">Annotation</span></h4>
<p>These tools produce annotative objects such as dimensions, texts, labels or grids, that are not used for modeling but to annotate your models and produce understandable drawings.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_34.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200409110145&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_34.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="183" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="183"></a></span>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Snapping">Snapping</span></h4>
<p>These tools turn <a href="Draft_Snap.html" title="Draft Snap">snapping</a> positions on/off. Like in most BIM applications, each additional snapping position adds calculation time when drawing, so it is best to only keep the ones you need turned on.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Modify">Modify</span></h4>
<p>These tools modify existing objects. They contain usual transformation tools such as Move or Rotate, plus a series of others that only work for specific object types.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Manage">Manage</span></h4>
<p>This category contains general management tools. Most of them allow you to edit BIM properties of a large group of objects simultaneously, without the need to select them.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prepare_your_working_space">Prepare your working space</span></h3>
<p>There are many ways to create BIM objects in FreeCAD. You can use the native <a href="BIM_Workbench.html" title="BIM Workbench">BIM tools</a> from this workbench, or use any other FreeCAD tool from other <a href="Workbenches.html" title="Workbenches">workbenches</a>. Both the <i>2D Drafting</i> and the <i>3D/BIM</i> tools from this workbench, unlike other workbenches such as Part Design, make extensive use of <b>working planes</b> and <b>snapping</b>.
</p><p>The <a href="Draft_SelectPlane.html" title="Draft SelectPlane">working plane</a> is where your next objects will be created. You can set it to one of the basic orthogonal planes (ground, front, side), or use any selected face to define the current working plane. You can also use <a href="Draft_WorkingPlaneProxy.html" title="Draft WorkingPlaneProxy">Working Plane Proxies</a> from menu <b>Utils</b> to store a specific working plane position inside your model. <a href="Arch_BuildingPart.html" title="Arch BuildingPart">Building Parts</a> also contain an implicit working plane position. Changing the current working plane is done by pressing the working plane button on the BIM toolbar. The <b>grid</b> always reflects where the working plane is.
</p><p>As you will have noticed, view angle and working plane are not tied together. You can work on your working plane from any view angle.
</p><p>Set the working plane in "Top" mode now:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_06.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20181114134457&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_06.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="232" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="495" data-file-height="383"></a></span>
</p><p>The <a href="Draft_Snap.html" title="Draft Snap">snapping tools</a> allow you to place new objects and points precisely according to existing geometry. However, enabling many snapping locations might slow down the drawing operations, so it is wise to only enable the snapping tools you intent to use. Take a moment to review what each of them does, so when needed you will know which can be disabled.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_07.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20181114134520&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_07.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="136" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="469" data-file-height="213"></a></span>
</p><p>Take special notice of the last one, the <b>working plane snapping</b> tool, as it will force any snapped point to lie on the working plane, thus preventing you to snap above or under the working plane. You will often need to turn it on or off, depending on the operation you are performing.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Draw_a_first_wall">Draw a first wall</span></h3>
<p>Let's start building our pavilion by creating some walls. Walls can be made either directly with the <a href="Arch_Wall.html" title="Arch Wall">wall</a> tool, or by first drawing 2D objects such as <a href="Draft_Line.html" title="Draft Line">lines</a>, <a href="Draft_Wire.html" title="Draft Wire">wires</a> (polylines) or <a href="Sketcher_NewSketch.html" title="Sketcher NewSketch">sketches</a>, that will define the baseline of our walls. When you have such a baseline object selected, pressing the Wall tool will automatically convert it into a wall.
</p><p>First, zoom out until a good part or all of the grid is seen. This will make it much easier to see what we are doing:

</p><p>After they are created, select both walls by pressing CTRL and clicking them both in the 3D View or in the <a href="Document_structure.html" title="Document structure">tree view</a>, and adjust their <b>height</b> property to 2.5 meters and their <b>width</b> to 20 centimeters (or any other measurement you are comfortable with, if working in another unit), so they look like this (Use the mouse to rotate the view, according to the navigation style you choose):
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_tutorial_08.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20181120210217&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_tutorial_08.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="203" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="1111" data-file-height="753"></a></span>
</p><p>You can always correct or change properties after a wall or any other BIM object has been created. By expanding the wall object in the tree view, then double-clicking the baseline of the wall, you can also modify its base 2D object. Most BIM objects in FreeCAD are based on another object, such as a baseline or a profile.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_tutorial_12.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190107225336&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_tutorial_12.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="230" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="338" data-file-height="259"></a></span>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Important_note">Important note</span></h4>
<p>You will notice that some property changes, in FreeCAD, don't reflect immediately on the object in the 3D View. Instead, the object is marked with a "to be recomputed" blue mark in the tree:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_20.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304194924&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_20.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="211" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="464" data-file-height="327"></a></span>
</p><p>The reason for this is that a FreeCAD document can be a very complex chain of inter-dependent objects. Updating one can trigger an update on many others, and therefore take a long time. To avoid this, some operations simply mark the object to be recomputed, and you trigger the recomputation yourself by using menu <b>Edit &rarr; Refresh</b> or pressing <b>Ctrl+R</b>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Draw_a_roof_slab">Draw a roof slab</span></h3>
<p>We will now place a roof slab on top of our walls. Instead of drawing the slab directly, like we did with the walls, we will here first draw a rectangle, then turn the rectangle into a slab. We will now explore two methods to do so, both are useful to know, so we suggest you to try one first, then undo it (or reload the file), and try the other method.
</p>
<h4><span id="Method_1:_Draw_the_slab_on_the_ground.2C_then_move_it_into_position"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Method_1:_Draw_the_slab_on_the_ground,_then_move_it_into_position">Method 1: Draw the slab on the ground, then move it into position</span></h4>
<p>It is often convenient to consider the top XY plane (the ground plane) as a kind of "drawing board", where we will be building our objects, and move then next to their correct position. There is an additional advantage here, our working plane is already in "Top" mode, so we don't need to change it.
</p><p>Set yourself in top view, zoom out a bit until you see both walls, and draw a rectangle encompassing them both. Press the <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Draft_Rectangle.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117141653&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Draft_Rectangle.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <b>Rectangle</b> button from the toolbar (or choose menu item <b>2D Drafting &rarr; Rectangle</b>):
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_18.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304193739&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_18.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="222" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="451" data-file-height="334"></a></span>
</p><p>Rotate your view to inspect the results. By default, the rectangle is filled with a face. This can be changed by changing the <b>Make Face</b> property of our rectangle to False. For the slab we are going to build, this has no impact, for other types of objects, however, the base object being a polyline or a face can make a difference.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_19.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304193924&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_19.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="220" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="486" data-file-height="356"></a></span>
</p><p>The next step is to build a slab by <i>extruding</i> it with our rectangle as its base <i>profile</i>. In FreeCAD, structural objects such as columns, beams, or slabs are all created using the same object called a <b>Structure</b>. After a structural object is created, setting its <b>IFC Type</b> property to the desired type (column, slab, etc&hellip;) is all that is needed to change its type.
</p><p>Make sure our rectangle is selected, then press the <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Slab.png&amp;filetimestamp=20191016184724&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Slab.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <b>Slab</b> button from the toolbar (or choose menu item <b>3D/BIM &rarr; Slab</b>). As stated above, this can also be done with the Column or Beam tools, as they all produce the same type of object. After our object is created, we need to make the following changes to its properties:
</p>
<ul><li>Set its <b>Height</b> to <b>20 cm</b></li>
<li>Verify its <b>IFC Type</b> is set to <b>Slab</b></li></ul>
<p>Now we need to move our new roof slab to its correct position, that is, above the walls. So we need to move it upwards, in the Z direction, by a distance of 250 cm, which is the height of our walls. We can simply edit the <b>Placement</b> property of our slab, expand its <b>Position</b> attribute, and set the value of <b>z</b> to 250 cm. Our slab is now well in place:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_21.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304195729&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_21.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="173" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="645" data-file-height="372"></a></span>
</p><p>Another way to move our slab to its correct position, is to use the <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Draft_Move.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117142503&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Draft_Move.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <b>Move</b> tool from the <b>Modify</b> menu. For that, we need to set our working plane in a vertical plane first, by pressing the <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Draft_SelectPlane.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117143205&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Draft_SelectPlane.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <b>working plane</b> button (make sure you don't have any face selected), and setting it to <b>XZ (Front)</b>. By setting ourselves in front view (press key <b>1</b>), we can now select the slab, press the <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Draft_Move.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117142503&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Draft_Move.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <b>Move</b> button, and move our slab by clicking one of its base points, and, with <b>Shift</b> pressed to restrict the movement vertically, click one point on top of the walls:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_23.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304202303&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_23.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="199" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="554" data-file-height="367"></a></span>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Method_2:_Draw_the_slab_directly_in_the_correct_plane">Method 2: Draw the slab directly in the correct plane</span></h4>
<p>Another useful method is directly working on the intended plane. We can easily set the working plane to the top surface of the walls, which is where we want our slab. Selecting a face and pressing the <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Draft_SelectPlane.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117143205&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Draft_SelectPlane.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <b>working plane</b> button sets the working plane to coincide with the selected face. Select the top face of the wall and set it as the current working plane. The placement of the grid moves to show the current working plane.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_22.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304200556&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_22.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="222" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="551" data-file-height="407"></a></span>
</p><p>Everything we draw from now on will happen in that plane. If you like, you can now set yourself in top view, but this is not necessary. Once your working plane is set, and if <b>working plane snapping</b> is enabled, you can draw directly in any type of 3D View.
</p><p>Once our rectangular <i>profile</i> is drawn, we can follow the same method as in method one to create a slab (select it, press the <b>Structure</b> button, adjust its properties).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Create_a_metallic_column">Create a metallic column</span></h3>
<p>Let's add a metallic column to give better support to our slab. Make sure the working plane is in <i>Top</i> mode, let's start by putting ourselves in top view (press key <b>2</b>), and turn the slab off, so we see better what's underneath. Select the slab, and press the <b>Space</b> key to turn its display off.
</p><p>In FreeCAD, it is very easy to turn objects or groups on and off, and the tree shows you clearly what is shown and what is hidden. Be sure to use that often!
</p><p>The <b>Column</b> tool (as well as the Beam tool) has some built-in profiles that we will use now. Make sure nothing is selected, then press the Column button. In the <b>Structure options</b>, select the category <b>CHS</b> (for "Circular Hollow Section"; RHS stands for "Rectangular Hollow Section", HEA, HEB, etc. are various "H" sections, etc.):
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_24.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304215603&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_24.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="217" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="414" data-file-height="299"></a></span>
</p><p>And click a point to place your column, more or less at this position. Make sure the new column has an IFC Type of "Column" and give it a Height of 250 cm to make it the same height as our walls.
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_25.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304215925&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_25.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="186" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="382" data-file-height="237"></a></span>
</p><p>The default CHS preset has a diameter option of 21.3 mm, which is too thin to support our concrete roof slab. Fortunately, as everything is parametric, it is easy to change the diameter. Expand the new structural object in the tree view, and you will find its profile object, named CHS21.3x2.6_. Change its diameter to 12 cm and its thickness to 8 mm. Now we have a strong enough column. Notice that you can specify units on the fly and switch between 0.8 cm and 8 mm without issue. FreeCAD will take care of conversion.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Add_a_support_plate">Add a support plate</span></h4>
<p>We need a way to attach our metal column to the concrete slab. So let's add a plate to its top, which can be bolted to the concrete slab. This will illustrate how you can easily modify BIM objects and create the very precise ones you need.
</p><p>Let's start by changing the height of our column from 250 cm to 249 cm, to give it a space for a 1 cm-thick plate. Then draw a 20 cm x 20 cm rectangle, either on the ground plane or by setting the top of the column as the current working plane, as we learned in the previous step. Use the <b>Move</b> tool, with midpoint and center snaps turned on, if needed, to center the rectangle over the column center.
</p><p>Using the Slab tool again, create a structural object from the rectangle, give it a height of 1 cm, and move it to a height of 249 cm:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_26.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304221738&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_26.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="192" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="554" data-file-height="354"></a></span>
</p><p>Now let's add our plate to the column. BIM objects in FreeCAD have two properties named <b>Additions</b> and <b>Subtractions</b> that can receive objects that need to be unioned or subtracted to/from them. To add the plate to our column, select the plate, then, with <b>Ctrl</b> pressed, select the column and use the <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Arch_Add.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117132250&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Arch_Add.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <b>Add</b> tool from the <b>Modify</b> menu. Our plate is now part of the column:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_27.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304224533&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_27.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="220" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="576" data-file-height="422"></a></span>
</p><p>By starting from simple shapes as <i>profiles</i>, and adding or subtracting objects, we can quickly create very complex BIM objects. Note that the Additions and Subtractions of a given BIM object can easily be changed by double-clicking them in the tree view and using the Add and Remove buttons there. The same object can also be used as an addition or subtraction to several other objects.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Add_a_door">Add a door</span></h3>
<p>Like columns and beams, doors and windows are created from the same <a href="Arch_Window.html" title="Arch Window">Window</a> object in FreeCAD. Only their IFC type changes. They can be independent or, if an object is selected when running the tool, inserted in another BIM object, in which case they will automatically create a hole through it.
</p><p>Let's insert a 80 cm x 210 cm glass door in one of our walls. Start by placing the working plane on a face of a wall, which will make it easier to precisely place our door:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_29.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304230644&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_29.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="212" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="610" data-file-height="432"></a></span>
</p><p>Then, with the wall selected, select <b>Door</b> from the <b>BIM</b> menu. Select the <b>Glass door</b> preset, and set the <b>Width</b> to 80 cm and <b>Height</b> to 210 cm. You can set the other values as you like:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_30.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20190304230933&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_30.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="247" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="416" data-file-height="343"></a></span>
</p><p>Click a point on the base of the wall where you wish to place the window. This can be difficult, as the grid lines don't necessarily correspond to the wall edges. Press the <b>Q</b> key while you have an active snap at a grid intersection, and press it again with an active snap on the bottom of the wall. FreeCAD will create a new snap point where their horizontal/vertical axis intersect. Use this to find a suitable point:

</p><p>If your door didn't get placed correctly, try the <b>Move</b> tool to move it to its correct position. Otherwise use undo or delete it from the model tree and try again.
</p><p>When everything is done, you should obtain a door properly inserted into its wall:

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Organizing_our_model">Organizing our model</span></h3>
<p>We now have in our model a growing collection of BIM objects. It is time to tidy things up. Creating well organized models, easily understandable by others, is a very important part of building quality BIM models.
</p><p>A first very simple and very good habit to take is to give proper and meaningful <b>names</b> to our objects, so we can easily identify them in the tree view later on. To rename an object, right-click it in the tree view and choose <b>Rename</b>. A model where components are easily identifiable by others is a huge part of what makes a good BIM model.
</p><p>Another interesting operation to do is <b>grouping</b>. Groups allow you to organize your objects in the tree view, like files and folders. An object can only belong to one group. Groups are created by right-clicking the document root or any other group in the tree view, and selecting <b>Create group</b>. You can then drag objects in and out of groups in the tree view.
</p><p>A third way to organize things is by using <b>layers</b>. Layers are independent of groups, you can use both systems at the same time if you wish. Like groups, layers allow you to easily turn on/off a series of objects, but unlike groups, they cannot be stacked inside one another. They also allow you to override visual settings such as the color and line width of their child objects. Layers are created and managed using the Layers manager tool found under menu <b>Manage &rarr; Manage layers&hellip;</b>. Objects are added or removed by dragging them in and out of layers in the tree view. The <b>Layer selector</b> on the main toolbar allows you to set a current layer. After doing so, any new 2D or BIM object will automatically be placed in that layer.
</p><p>Finally, BIM applications usually allow you to group objects into <b>levels</b> (or storeys) and <b>buildings</b>. FreeCAD offers these tools as well under the <b>3D/BIM</b> menu. Like beams and columns, levels and buildings use the same object type called <a href="Arch_BuildingPart.html" title="Arch BuildingPart">Building Part</a> with a different IFC type. They work the same way as groups, once created, you can drag and drop any object in and out of it. Building Parts are compatible with groups, so you can place groups inside them.

</p><p>Building Parts have many other uses, refer to their <a href="Arch_BuildingPart.html" title="Arch BuildingPart">documentation</a> to know more.
</p><p>Create a Building Part now by selecting <b>Level</b> from the <b>3D/BIM</b> menu. Make sure its IFC type is set to <b>Building Storey</b>, and drag all our other root BIM objects (no need to do so with included objects like the door or the plate of the column) into it, that is, our two walls, the roof slab and the metal column.
</p><p>Note that, as Building Parts are generic building components, you are not forced to organize your model by levels in FreeCAD. You can choose to group your elements differently. But the IFC format expects things to be grouped by level, so if you plan to use that format, it is best to consider your Building Parts as levels.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_section_planes">Adding section planes</span></h3>
<p>One of the most common operations performed on a BIM model is to extract 2D drawings from it, such as plans or elevations. There are several ways to do that in FreeCAD, depending on the result you wish to obtain. Basically, you have two choices: 
</p>
<ul><li>Producing the 2D result inside the 3D space. This is useful if you wish to rework it there, build further on it or better control how it is exported to formats like <a href="Draft_DXF.html" title="Draft DXF">DXF</a> or <a href="FreeCAD_and_DWG_Import.html" title="FreeCAD and DWG Import">DWG</a>.</li>
<li>Creating 2D views on a <a href="TechDraw_Workbench.html" title="TechDraw Workbench">TechDraw sheet</a> that is better suited for impression or export to PDF.</li></ul>
<p>In both cases, it starts with placing a <a href="Arch_SectionPlane.html" title="Arch SectionPlane">Section Plane</a> in your model:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_37.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200409152334&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_37.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="141" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="141"></a></span>
</p>
<ol><li>Select the Level object that contains your objects, that we created in the last step</li>
<li>Add a Section Plane from menu <b>Annotations &rarr; Section Plane</b></li></ol>
<p>Section planes don't cut through the whole model, but only through objects in their <b>Objects</b> property. You can select the Section Plane to check and change the contents of this property anytime.
</p><p>By default, the new section plane will be placed in the middle of the selected object or its contents, and will look downwards, as to create a floor plan view. But the section plane is an object like any other and can be moved and rotated to do what you need. Place it horizontally to create a plan view, vertically inside your model to create a section, or outside the model to create an elevation.
</p><p><b>Tutorial steps</b>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Extracting_2D_views_as_geometry">Extracting 2D views as geometry</span></h3>
<p>Once your section plane is in place we can create 2D geometry from what it sees using the <a href="BIM_Shape2DView.html" title="BIM Shape2DView">Shape-based view</a> tool:
</p><p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_38.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200409153252&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_38.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="179" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="179"></a></span>
</p>
<ol><li>Select the section plane</li>
<li>Create a Shape 2D View using <b>Annotation &rarr; Shape-based view</b></li>
<li>Our view object is hidden under the walls. Hide the level and the section plane by selecting them both in the tree view and pressing the space bar, so we can see our result better:</li></ol>
<p><span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_39.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200409153327&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_39.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="186" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="186"></a></span>
</p><p>The 2D view we created is an all-in-one 2D object and will be located on the (0,0) ground plane in the model. It can be moved around, and will be recalculated if the model changes.
</p><p>To create thicker lines for cut areas, you can create another Shape 2D view, and set its <b>Projection Mode</b> property to "Cutlines" or "Cutfaces", and its <b>In Place</b> property to "False". You will then have two objects, one for viewed lines and one for cut lines, for which you can give different line thicknesses.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Annotating_and_exporting_to_2D_CAD_formats">Annotating and exporting to 2D CAD formats</span></h3>
<p>You can place <a href="Draft_Text.html" title="Draft Text">Texts</a>, <a href="Draft_Label.html" title="Draft Label">Labels</a> (text with line and arrow), <a href="Draft_Dimension.html" title="Draft Dimension">Dimensions</a> on anything in the model space: Either directly on the 3D model, or on the 2D view that we created in the step above. The choice is yours, depending on what you wish to achieve. If you leave the 2D view exactly under the 3D model, you might also want to do both in one go.
</p><p><span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_34.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200409110145&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_34.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="183" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="183"></a></span>
</p><p>Annotations (texts, labels, dimensions) will be placed on the current <b>Working Plane</b>. Be sure to place your working plane where you want your annotations. You can this way place annotations in any plane of the 3D space: Horizontally or vertically. You can also move or rotate them after creation.
</p><p>Let's place a horizontal dimension between the extremities of our two walls:
</p><p><span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_40.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200410110609&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_40.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="184" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="184"></a></span>
</p>
<ol><li>Set the <b>working plane</b> to <b>Top</b> position</li>
<li>Orient your view to be able to view the base of both walls</li>
<li>Choose menu <b>Annotations</b> &rarr; <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Draft_Dimension.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117141720&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Draft_Dimension.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <a href="Draft_Dimension.html" title="Draft Dimension">Dimension</a></li>
<li>Click a first point at the extremity of the left wall</li>
<li>Press <b>SHIFT</b> to constrain the dimension vertically or horizontally</li>
<li>Click a second point at the extremity of the right wall</li>
<li>Click a third point to indicate where to place the dimension line</li></ol>
<p><a href="Draft_Dimension.html" title="Draft Dimension">Dimensions</a> have a lot of settings to tweak their aspect and the size and type of the text and arrow. You can set your preferred defaults under menu <b>Edit &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Draft &rarr; Texts and dimensions</b>.
</p><p>Now let's add a text:
</p><p><span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=BIM_Tutorial_41.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20200410110623&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/BIM_Tutorial_41.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="195" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="300" data-file-height="195"></a></span>
</p>
<ol><li>Choose menu <b>Annotations</b> &rarr; <span typeof="mw:File"><a href="index.php?title=Draft_Text.png&amp;filetimestamp=20170117141707&amp;.html" class="mw-file-description"><img src="File/Draft_Text.png" decoding="async" width="16" height="16" class="mw-file-element" data-file-width="64" data-file-height="64"></a></span> <a href="Draft_Text.html" title="Draft Text">Text</a></li>
<li>Click a location in the 3D View to place the text</li>
<li>Write the text you wish, for example <b>Pavilion</b>, then click the <b>Create text</b> button or press Enter twice.</li></ol>
<p>A good idea is to create <b>Groups</b> for the different sets of annotations (plan, section, different scales, etc&hellip;):
</p>
<ol><li>Create a group by right-clicking the document root and select <b>Create group</b>, rename it to "Annotations"</li>
<li>Select the annotations we created above in the tree and drag and drop them into the group</li></ol>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Exporting_to_DXF">Exporting to DXF</span></h4>
<p>2D objects such as lines or circles or 2D views as we created above or annotations are very suited to export to traditional 2D CAD formats such as <a href="Draft_DXF.html" title="Draft DXF">DXF or DWG</a>. The DWG format requires an additional piece of software to be installed on your system, check the <a href="Draft_DXF.html" title="Draft DXF">instructions</a> to do that if needed.
</p><p>Let's try to export our 2D work to DXF:
</p>
<ol><li>Select the 2D view, the dimension and the text</li>
<li>Select menu <b>File &rarr; Export</b>, choose the <b>Autodesk DXF</b>format, a file name, and press <b>Export</b></li></ol>
<p>If you don't use any 2D CAD program, there are several free and open-source applications that can open DXF files (apart from FreeCAD itself, of course!) such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://librecad.org/">LibreCAD</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://qcad.org/">QCAD CE</a>.

<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes">IFC, or Industry Foundation Classes</a>, is a protocol and file format for exchanging BIM models between applications. By saving your model as an IFC file, you will be able to open it in most or all other open-source or proprietary BIM applications out there.
</p><p>IFC import/export operations in FreeCAD are performed by an external piece of software called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ifcopenshell.org">IfcOpenShell</a>. Read the <a href="Arch_IFC.html" title="Arch IFC">Arch IFC</a> page to learn more about how to install it.
</p><p>Once IfcOpenShell is installed, exporting your model as an IFC file is as simple as selecting the objects you wish to export, or just the top container (group or Building Part) that contains all other objects you wish to export, and use menu <b>File &rarr; Export</b> and choose the IFC file format.
</p><p>Finally, once you have exported an IFC file, it is always a good idea to inspect it before sending it to other people, to make sure the model looks good and no object is missing. There are many free IFC viewer applications available on the internet for many platforms. A good, open-source viewer that works on all platforms is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ifcquery.com/">IFC++</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Managing_BIM_properties">Managing BIM properties</span></h3>
<p>A huge part of what makes a good BIM model are the non-geometry properties that you can give to your objects, such as type, material, or properties specific to a certain type. For example, a wall can be marked as load-bearing or not. Or as exterior or interior. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes">IFC format</a> is very rich in that regard. The amount of specifications and properties you want to give your objects depends mostly on your needs and how you work with others and what they expect your BIM model to contain.
</p><p>One thing is important to keep in mind: all BIM/Arch objects in FreeCAD support the full set of IFC properties. Other FreeCAD objects, such as those modeled with other workbenches, will also be exported to IFC but you cannot change any of their IFC properties. You can however convert any FreeCAD object to a BIM object by selecting the object and using <b>3D/BIM &rarr; Create Component</b>.
</p><p>The main pieces of information you can give your objects are:
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Name_and_description">Name and description</span></h4>
<p>This seems obvious, but the simplest way to make your model more understandable to others is to properly name each of your objects, and, if relevant, add a description. This is done simply by selecting an object, and pressing <b>F2</b>, or change its <b>Label</b> property to rename it. The Description will be found among the object properties.
</p>
<h4><span id="The_BIM.2FIFC_type"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="The_BIM/IFC_type">The BIM/IFC type</span></h4>
<p>This is the most fundamental piece of information. In FreeCAD, an object created with the wall tool will have its IFC type set to "Wall" by default. But you can change this anytime. So you can use the wall tool to model a beam for example. You only need to change its IFC type after creating it. To change the IFC type of an object, select it, find its <b>IFC Type</b> in its properties, and change to another type from the drop-down list.
</p><p>You can also bulk-manage names, types and materials of several objects at a time using the IFC elements manager found under menu <b>Manage &rarr; Manage IFC elements&hellip;</b>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Materials">Materials</span></h4>
<p>Each object of a construction has a material. So it makes sense to give each object of your model a proper material, such as concrete or wood. To attribute a material to an object, select the object, and use the <a href="Arch_SetMaterial.html" title="Arch SetMaterial">materials manager</a> from menu <b>Manage &rarr; Material</b>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Properties">Properties</span></h4>
<p>Each BIM object can also receive additional properties, for example to indicate that a wall is load-bearing or not. IFC allows you to add custom properties to just anything, but most types such as Wall or Beam also have special, predefined sets of properties, usually named Pset_WallCommon or Pset_BeamCommon. You can choose to add these sets to your objects, modify the value of the properties contained in the set, or add your custom properties. Managing the IFC properties for a selected object or bulk edit the properties of several objects at a time is done using the properties manager under menu <b>Manage &rarr; Manage IFC properties&hellip;</b>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Quantities">Quantities</span></h4>
<p>Quantities such as length or width or height of a wall can also be specifically written to an IFC file. They are not linked to the geometry of the object, so when meeting such quantities in an IFC file there is no guarantee that they reflect the actual object geometry. However, these quantities allow applications that are not able to process the geometry, such as spreadsheet applications, to know the principal dimensions of objects. You can check which quantities will be exported to IFC using the quantities manager found under menu <b>Manage &rarr; Manage IFC quantities&hellip;</b>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="BIM_Preflight_tool">BIM Preflight tool</span></h4>
<p>The IFC format has many particularities and sometimes the application you will be opening your IFC file with or the person who will receive your IFC file will have further requirements. Becoming a fluent BIM modeller often means to get familiar with all these particularities and what needs to be added or specified to your BIM model. The BIM Workbench of FreeCAD provides a <a href="BIM_Preflight.html" title="BIM Preflight">BIM Preflight</a> tool that allows you to check your model for several of these particularities and most common requirements, and help you decide what to include in your model or not.

</p><p>FreeCAD is a big family of workbenches, and tools from other workbenches often come in handy. As we saw above, almost any object created from other workbenches can be turned into a valid BIM object, simply using the <b>3D/BIM &rarr; Generic 3D tools &rarr; Component</b> tool and giving it the correct IFC type.
