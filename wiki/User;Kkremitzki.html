I'm Kurt. I work on FreeCAD's infrastructure, dependencies, and distribution.
</p><p>I first encountered FreeCAD around 2012, which was my "fully switched to Linux" year. I was planning on going back to school for biosystems engineering, and wanted a capable, free-software CAD. At the time, it was still quite rough around the edges, so I only rarely used it, but kept following community developments.
</p><p>Eventually, FreeCAD kept getting more refined until, by the time I was a junior, I decided to buckle down and join the FreeCAD community. Since then, I've taken on a sort of devops role, handling systems administration of the project and also working on Debian packaging for the project. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://salsa.debian.org/kkremitzki-guest">I also work on the Debian Science Team to package other useful engineering software</a>; by improving things at the source, Debian and its derivatives like Ubuntu and Linux Mint will become even better for engineers and engineering students around the world!
</p><p>My long-term plan is become a FreeCAD core developer, although for now I have lots of general ecosystem improvements in the works. If you find this work useful and would like to support me, please head over to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.patreon.com/kkremitzki">My Patreon!</a>
