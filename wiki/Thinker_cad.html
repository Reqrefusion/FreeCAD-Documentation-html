</p><p>Create a detailed and clear 3D engineering model using FreeCAD for an academic research project titled:
</p><p>&ldquo;Design of a Sand-Based Thermal Heat Exchanger System Using Buried Copper Pipes.&rdquo;
</p><p>The model should include the following elements with accurate proportions and parametric dimensions:
</p><p>1. Insulated Wooden Box:
</p><p>Rectangular box with dimensions 2 m (length) &times; 2 m (width) &times; 1 m (height).
Wooden outer structure with an internal insulation layer.
The box should be filled with sand.
</p><p>2. Sand Layer:
</p><p>Homogeneous sand volume inside the box.
Indicate the sand level clearly.
</p><p>3. Copper Pipe Heat Exchanger:
</p><p>Total pipe length: 30 meters.
Material: copper.
Pipes arranged in a coiled (serpentine) configuration.
Pipes buried at a depth of 50 cm from the top surface of the sand.
Pipes fully embedded inside the sand volume.
</p><p>4. Hydraulic Circuit (Closed Loop):
</p><p>Inlet and outlet copper pipes exiting the box.
Connection to an external water storage tank.
Include a circulation pump connected to form a closed-loop system.
</p><p>5. Measurement Instruments:
</p><p>Temperature sensor at the pipe inlet.
Temperature sensor at the pipe outlet.
Flow meter installed on the pipe to measure water flow rate.
</p><p>6. Visualization Requirements:
</p><p>Use simple colors to distinguish materials (wood, sand, copper, water circuit).
Include a sectional cut view to clearly show buried pipes inside the sand.
Label all main components (box, sand, pipes, pump, tank, sensors).
Ensure the design is clean, technical, and suitable for inclusion in a scientific research paper.
</p><p>7. Units and Standards:
</p><p>Units: meters (m).
Scale: realistic (1:1).
Purpose: scientific visualization and engineering analysis (not aesthetic rendering).
