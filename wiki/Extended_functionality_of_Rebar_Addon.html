<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rebar_Addon_and_its_limitation">Rebar Addon and its limitation</span></h3>
<p>The project is aimed at easing up the process of rebaring in FreeCAD. In this project, list of rebars will be provided to a user in the form of dropdown. On selecting rebar from dropdown, a dialog box will pop out with input fields where a user can provide data related to selected rebar.
</p><p>But there is one big limitation due to which it is not much use in the real world. The problem is, a user has to do a lot of manual work to produce a single drawing sheet.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Workflow">Workflow</span></h3>
<p>The user should select a component and then click on some button (say &lsquo;Drawing`). After clicking on a button, a new popup window should open. In the popup window, there should be a table on which a list of rebars is shown. From that table user will select rebars he/she want to include in a drawing sheet and then click on &lsquo;OK&rsquo; button. The output of drawing sheets should be in SVG format.
