<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/">Cycles</a> is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a>'s new realistic renderer. Cycles has also been made <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Source/Render/Cycles/Standalone">standalone</a>, and several other 3D modelers such as Rhino and Cinema4D are beginning to use it too.
</p><p>As the <a href="Raytracing_Workbench.html" title="Raytracing Workbench">Raytracing Workbench</a> of FreeCAD is already made to support several render engines, it is fairly easy to add a new one.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Details">Details</span></h2>
<ol><li>Get familiar with the Cycles render engine as used in Blender. You might need to learn to use Blender, as it is the primary tool to use Cycles.</li>
<li>Learn how to build Cycles on the different platforms. As the standalone version of Cycles is not yet as popular as Blender itself, precompiled packages are not available</li>
<li>Learn the XML API of Cycles, how data can be passed to the renderer</li>
<li>Create basic functionality in FreeCAD to create such XML files</li>
<li>Create a new render object by adapting the luxrender object</li></ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Future_Possibilities">Future Possibilities</span></h2>
<p>Since direct modeling is a huge area in constant evolution, the work done in this GSoC will only cover a small part of it. But if the bases are done right, extending them will be easy and could develop very far.
